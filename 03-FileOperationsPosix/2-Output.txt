On success, the number of bytes written is returned.  On error,
       -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       Note that a successful write() may transfer fewer than count
       bytes.  Such partial writes can occur for various reasons; for
       example, because there was insufficient space on the disk device
       to write all of the requested bytes, or because a blocked write()
       to a socket, pipe, or similar was interrupted by a signal handler
       after it had transferred some, but before it had transferred all
       of the requested bytes.  In the event of a partial write, the
       caller can make another write() call to transfer the remaining
       bytes.  The subsequent call will either transfer further bytes or
       may result in an error (e.g., if the disk is now full).

       If count is zero and fd refers to a regular file, then write()
       may return a failure status if one of the errors below is
       detected.  If no errors are detected, or error detection is not
       performed, 0 is returned without causing any other effect.  If
       count is zero and fd refers to a file other than a regular file,
       the results are not specified.
