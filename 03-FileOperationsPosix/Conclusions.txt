1. Linux file has a '\n' at the end of each line, including the last line.

2. Read() will just read the assigned number of bytes at its 3rd parameter, including the '\n' at the end of each line.
   At the end of the file, read() will also read this '\n'. There should be something else at the end of the file, but read()
   only reads the last '\n'.
